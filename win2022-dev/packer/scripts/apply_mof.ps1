.SYNOPSIS
    Applies the compiled DSC MOF to enforce STIG controls.

.NOTES
    FIX: Added explicit exit code detection using both $LASTEXITCODE and
         exception handling so failures are not silently swallowed.
    FIX: Added pre-application check to confirm the MOF exists and is
         not zero-length before calling Start-DscConfiguration.

    Run order: AFTER create_mof.ps1, BEFORE account_policy.ps1
    (account_policy.ps1 re-applies policies that DSC may fail to set
    due to the SCE database lock during Packer image builds)
